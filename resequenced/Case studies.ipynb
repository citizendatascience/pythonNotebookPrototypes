    "# Become a citizen data scientist\n",
    "\n",
    "Professionals who spend their day devising algorithms for processing data are known as **data scientists**. Data scientists are few and far between, and in many organisations there is a need for training the current staff to perform analytical tasks in-house.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore the idea of a **citizen data scientist** came about. A citizen data scientist is close enough to the problem context to really understand it, but also equipped with the skills needed to investigate it scientifically.\n",
    "\n",
    "But to us, the idea of a **citizen data scientist** has an additional meaning. In any democratic organisation - whether it is a nation, a city council or a secondary school - it is up to the citizens to make informed judgments, based on facts and supported by data. And when local issues arise and no expert data scientists are available, it is up to the citizens to also collect and analyse it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This course has been designed to provide you with the skills required for you to trust your own ability to generate facts and use them for the greater good. At the end of it, you will be ready to get your hands dirty in how to identify research questions, collect data, and using Python programming, submit it for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scientific method is freely available for anyone to use, and sociatally vital facts are out there waiting impatiently to be discovered. \n",
    "\n",
    "Be the citizen data scientist your community needs."

    "## Food waste in the canteen: two dependent samples\n",
    "\n",
    "Some time ago, Fatemah stumbled upon the statistic that UK households throw almost 7 million tonnes per year, with around 70 kg per person - about a third of the food the purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "This led Fatemah to inquire about the food waste at the lunch canteen. She had seen the waste bins overfill, one after one. Some of it were from the cooking staff making too big batches, but the majority seemed to be from students overestimating their appetites. Was there a way to reduce the average food waste per student?\n",
    "\n",
    "Fatemah got permission from her principal to set up a table in the canteen after the food queue, and asked people to weigh their food as she put it into a spreadsheet, alongside their numerical ID. She did the same when they returned their trays.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next day, she made an installation in the school entrance with a 70 recycled milk cartons with the sign \"**THIS IS HOW MUCH FOOD YOU WILL WASTE THIS YEAR**\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Would this technique make people more conscious of how much they wasted? To see the effect of the installation, Fatemah repeated the previous procedure of weighing plates."
