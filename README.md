# Python Notebook Prototypes

As part of the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk) MOOC
development project with [The Data Lab](https://www.thedatalab.com) we are 
investigating how school pupils explore data with interactive notebooks.

This repo contains several example datasets and prototype Jupyter
notebooks.
